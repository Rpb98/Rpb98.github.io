abstract: Photochemistry is a fundamental process of planetary atmospheres that regulates
  the atmospheric composition and stability1. However, no unambiguous photochemical
  products have been detected in exoplanet atmospheres so far. Recent observations
  from the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program2,3 found
  a spectral absorption feature at 4.05 $μ$m arising from sulfur dioxide (SO2) in
  the atmosphere of WASP-39b. WASP-39b is a 1.27-Jupiter-radii, Saturn-mass (0.28
  MJ) gas giant exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star with an equilibrium temperature
  of around 1,100 K (ref. 4). The most plausible way of generating SO2 in such an
  atmosphere is through photochemical processes5,6. Here we show that the SO2 distribution
  computed by a suite of photochemical models robustly explains the 4.05-$μ$m spectral
  feature identified by JWST transmission observations7 with NIRSpec PRISM (2.7$σ$)8
  and G395H (4.5$σ$)9. SO2 is produced by successive oxidation of sulfur radicals
  freed when hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is destroyed. The sensitivity of the SO2 feature
  to the enrichment of the atmosphere by heavy elements (metallicity) suggests that
  it can be used as a tracer of atmospheric properties, with WASP-39b exhibiting an
  inferred metallicity of about 10$times$ solar. We further point out that SO2 also
  shows observable features at ultraviolet and thermal infrared wavelengths not available
  from the existing observations.
