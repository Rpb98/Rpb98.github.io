 abstract = {The recent inference of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere
of the hot (approximately 1,100 K), Saturn-mass exoplanet
WASP-39b from near-infrared JWST observations1-3 suggests that
photochemistry is a key process in high-temperature exoplanet
atmospheres4. This is because of the low (<1 ppb) abundance of
SO2 under thermochemical equilibrium compared with that produced
from the photochemistry of H2O and H2S (1-10 ppm)4-9. However,
the SO2 inference was made from a single, small molecular
feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b at 4.05 $μ$m
and, therefore, the detection of other SO2 absorption bands at
different wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO2
abundance. Here we report the detection of SO2 spectral features
at 7.7 and 8.5 $μ$m in the 5-12-$μ$m transmission spectrum
of WASP-39b measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)
Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS)10. Our observations suggest an
abundance of SO2 of 0.5-25 ppm (1$σ$ range), consistent
with previous findings4. As well as SO2, we find broad
water-vapour absorption features, as well as an unexplained
decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths longer than 10
$μ$m. Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward
models, we derive an atmospheric heavy-element content
(metallicity) for WASP-39b of approximately 7.1-8.0 times solar
and demonstrate that photochemistry shapes the spectra of
WASP-39b across a broad wavelength range.},
