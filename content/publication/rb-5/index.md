abstract: A semi-empirical IR/Vis line list, SOLIS, for the sulphur monoxide molecule
  32S16O is presented. SOLIS includes accurate empirical rovibrational energy levels,
  uncertainties, lifetimes, quantum number assignments, and transition probabilities
  in the form of Einstein A coefficients covering the $X, ̂3Σ ^-$$, a, ̂1Δ , b, ^1̂Σ
  ^+, A, ^̂Π , B, ^̂Σ ^-, A^prime prime , ^3̂Σ ^+, A^prime , ^3Δ̂$, and $e, ^1̂$ systems
  and wavenumber range up to 43 303.5 cm−1 (≥230.93 nm) with J ≤ 69. SOLIS has been
  computed by solving the rovibronic Schrödinger equation for diatomics using the
  general purpose variational code Duo and starting from a published ab initio spectroscopic
  model of SO (including potential energy curves, coupling curves, (transition) dipole
  moment curves) which is refined to experimental data. To this end, a database of
  50 106 experimental transitions, 48 972 being non-redundant, has been compiled through
  the analysis of 29 experimental sources, and a self-consistent network of 8558 rovibronic
  energy levels for the X, a, b, A, B, and C electronic states has been generated
  with the marvel algorithm covering rotational and vibrational quantum numbers J
  ≤ 69 and v ≤ 30 and energies up to 52 350.40 cm−1. No observed transitions connect
  to the $B, ^3^̂-$(v = 0) state which is required to model perturbations correctly,
  so we leave fitting the $B, ^3Σ ^- ̂and $C, ^3Π$ st̂e UV model to a future project.
  The SO line list is available at ExoMol from www.exomol.com.
