abstract: 'Empirical line lists BRYTS for the open shell molecule 89Y16O (yttrium
  oxide) and its isotopologues are presented. The line lists cover the six lowest
  electronic states: $X, ̂2Σ ^+$, $A, ̂2Π$, $A^prime , ^2̂Δ$, $B, ^̂Σ ^+$, $C, ^̂Π$,
  and $D, ^2̂Σ ^+$ up to 60 000 cm−1 (&lt;0.167 $μ$m) for rotational excitation up
  to J = 400.5. An ab initio spectroscopic model consisting of potential energy curves
  (PECs), spin–orbit, and electronic angular momentum couplings is refined by fitting
  to experimentally determined energies of YO, derived from published YO experimental
  transition frequency data. The model is complemented by empirical spin-rotation
  and Λ-doubling curves and ab initio dipole moment and transition dipole moment curves
  computed using multireference configuration interaction (MRCI). The ab initio PECs
  computed using the complete basis set limit extrapolation and the coupled-cluster
  CCSD(T) method with its higher quality provide an excellent initial approximation
  for the refinement. Non-adiabatic coupling curves for two pairs of states of the
  same symmetry A/C and B/D are computed using a state-averaged complete active space
  self-consistant field theory (CASSCF) and used to build diabatic representations
  for the $A, ^2Π̂$, $C, ^2̂$, $B, ^2^̂+$, and $D, ^2Σ̂+$ curves. The experimentally
  derived energies of 89Y16O utilized in the fit are used to replace the corresponding
  calculated energy values in the BRYTS line list. Simulated spectra of YO show excellent
  agreement with the experiment, where it is available. Calculated lifetimes of YO
  are tuned to agree well with the experiment, where available. The BRYTS YO line
  lists are available from the ExoMol database (www.exomol.com).'
