      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        Iâ€™m a PhD student with the ExoMol group at UCL, specializing in untangling "spaghetti" curves in the adiabatic representation of nuclear dynamics. My research focuses on studying non-adiabatic interactions, particularly those induced by non-Born-Oppenheimer and Spin-Orbit dynamics. A key achievement during my PhD has been developing a theoretical and computational framework for extracting a smooth and intuitive diabatic representation for an arbitrary number of coupled electronic states.

        In addition to my research, I am "Mr. Sulfur Monoxide" within ExoMol. I have developed an IR/Vis line list for sulfur monoxide (SO) during my MSci and PhD projects. The SOLIS line list was used in atmospheric retrievals of the hot Jupiter exoplanet WASP-39b using JWST data. This work has led to the detection of SO in the exoplanetâ€™s atmosphere, alongside the discovery of SO2.
