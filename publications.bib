abstract = {The ExoMol database (www.exomol.com) provides molecular data for spectroscopic studies of hot atmospheres. These data are widely used to model atmospheres of exoplanets, cool stars and other astronomical objects, as well as a variety of terrestrial applications. The 2024 data release reports the current status of the database which contains recommended line lists for 91 molecules and 224 isotopologues giving a total of almost 1012 individual transitions. New features of the database include extensive “MARVELization” of line lists to allow them to be used for high resolutions studies, extension of several line lists to ultraviolet wavelengths, provision of photodissociation cross-sections and extended provision of broadening parameters. Some of the in-house data specifications have been rewritten in JSON and moved for conformity with other international standards. Data products, including specific heats, a database of lifetimes for plasma studies, and the ExoMolHR web app which allows exclusively high resolution data to be extracted, are discussed.}

abstract = {To meet burning needs of high-resolution pressure-induced line-shape parameters in the UV/visible regions for hot-temperature industrial and atmospheric applications as well as current and future space missions, phase-shift theory is examined in its historical context, tested and revisited using accurate numerical potentials and advanced trajectory models. First, a general analysis for arbitrary molecular systems is conducted in terms of the dimensionless parameter α determined by the differences of the Lennard-Jones parameters in the final and initial electronic absorber’s states. Temperature dependence, use of the power law and influence of Maxwell–Boltzmann averaging over relative velocities are addressed. Then, interaction-potential calculations are attempted for some representative molecular pairs (NO-Ar, NO-N2, OH-Ar and OH-N2) and the isotropic parts are fitted using the 12-6 Lennard-Jones form to get room and high-temperature line-broadening and line-shift coefficients which are compared to available measurements. It is shown that the phase-shift theory in its standard rectilinear-trajectory formulation provides linewidth and shift estimates accurate within 30%–40%. Attempted improvements using numerical potentials and curved trajectories lead to closer matches with measurements for some cases but also worsen the agreement for others. To ensure better theoretical predictions, introduction of correction terms to the usual phase-shift integral is suggested.}

  abstract  = "The recent inference of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere
               of the hot (approximately 1,100 K), Saturn-mass exoplanet
               WASP-39b from near-infrared JWST observations1-3 suggests that
               photochemistry is a key process in high-temperature exoplanet
               atmospheres4. This is because of the low (<1 ppb) abundance of
               SO2 under thermochemical equilibrium compared with that produced
               from the photochemistry of H2O and H2S (1-10 ppm)4-9. However,
               the SO2 inference was made from a single, small molecular
               feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b at 4.05 $\mu$m
               and, therefore, the detection of other SO2 absorption bands at
               different wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO2
               abundance. Here we report the detection of SO2 spectral features
               at 7.7 and 8.5 $\mu$m in the 5-12-$\mu$m transmission spectrum
               of WASP-39b measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)
               Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS)10. Our observations suggest an
               abundance of SO2 of 0.5-25 ppm (1$\sigma$ range), consistent
               with previous findings4. As well as SO2, we find broad
               water-vapour absorption features, as well as an unexplained
               decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths longer than 10
               $\mu$m. Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward
               models, we derive an atmospheric heavy-element content
               (metallicity) for WASP-39b of approximately 7.1-8.0 times solar
               and demonstrate that photochemistry shapes the spectra of
               WASP-39b across a broad wavelength range.",

  abstract = "Photochemistry is a fundamental process of planetary atmospheres
              that regulates the atmospheric composition and stability1.
              However, no unambiguous photochemical products have been detected
              in exoplanet atmospheres so far. Recent observations from the
              JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science
              Program2,3 found a spectral absorption feature at 4.05 $\mu$m
              arising from sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of WASP-39b.
              WASP-39b is a 1.27-Jupiter-radii, Saturn-mass (0.28 MJ) gas giant
              exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star with an equilibrium
              temperature of around 1,100 K (ref. 4). The most plausible way of
              generating SO2 in such an atmosphere is through photochemical
              processes5,6. Here we show that the SO2 distribution computed by
              a suite of photochemical models robustly explains the 4.05-$\mu$m
              spectral feature identified by JWST transmission observations7
              with NIRSpec PRISM (2.7$\sigma$)8 and G395H (4.5$\sigma$)9. SO2
              is produced by successive oxidation of sulfur radicals freed when
              hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is destroyed. The sensitivity of the SO2
              feature to the enrichment of the atmosphere by heavy elements
              (metallicity) suggests that it can be used as a tracer of
              atmospheric properties, with WASP-39b exhibiting an inferred
              metallicity of about 10$\times$ solar. We further point out that
              SO2 also shows observable features at ultraviolet and thermal
              infrared wavelengths not available from the existing
              observations.",
