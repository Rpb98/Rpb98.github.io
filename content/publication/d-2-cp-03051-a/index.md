abstract: We present an ab initio study of the rovibronic spectra of sulphur monoxide
  (32S16O) using internally contracted multireference configuration interaction (ic-MRCI)
  method and aug-cc-pV5Z basis sets. It covers 13 electronic states X3Σ−, a1Δ, b1Σ+,
  c1Σ−, A′′3Σ+, A′3Δ, A3Π, B3Σ−, C3Π, d1Π, e1Π, C′3Π, and (3)1Π ranging up to 66 800
  cm−1. The ab initio spectroscopic model includes 13 potential energy curves, 23
  dipole and transition dipole moment curves, 23 spin–orbit curves, and 14 electronic
  angular momentum curves. A diabatic representation is built by removing the avoided
  crossings between the spatially degenerate pairs C3Π–C′3Π and e1Π–(3)1Π through
  a property-based diabatisation method. We also present non-adiabatic couplings and
  diabatic couplings for these avoided crossing systems. All phases for our coupling
  curves are defined, and consistent, providing the first fully reproducible spectroscopic
  model of SO covering the wavelength range longer than 147 nm. Finally, an ab initio
  rovibronic spectrum of SO is computed.
