abstract: The recent inference of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of the hot
  (approximately 1,100 K), Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b from near-infrared JWST
  observations1-3 suggests that photochemistry is a key process in high-temperature
  exoplanet atmospheres4. This is because of the low (<1 ppb) abundance of SO2 under
  thermochemical equilibrium compared with that produced from the photochemistry of
  H2O and H2S (1-10 ppm)4-9. However, the SO2 inference was made from a single, small
  molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b at 4.05 $μ$m and, therefore,
  the detection of other SO2 absorption bands at different wavelengths is needed to
  better constrain the SO2 abundance. Here we report the detection of SO2 spectral
  features at 7.7 and 8.5 $μ$m in the 5-12-$μ$m transmission spectrum of WASP-39b
  measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer
  (LRS)10. Our observations suggest an abundance of SO2 of 0.5-25 ppm (1$σ$ range),
  consistent with previous findings4. As well as SO2, we find broad water-vapour absorption
  features, as well as an unexplained decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths
  longer than 10 $μ$m. Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models,
  we derive an atmospheric heavy-element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b of approximately
  7.1-8.0 times solar and demonstrate that photochemistry shapes the spectra of WASP-39b
  across a broad wavelength range.
