abstract: The ExoMol database (www.exomol.com) provides molecular data for spectroscopic
  studies of hot atmospheres. These data are widely used to model atmospheres of exoplanets,
  cool stars and other astronomical objects, as well as a variety of terrestrial applications.
  The 2024 data release reports the current status of the database which contains
  recommended line lists for 91 molecules and 224 isotopologues giving a total of
  almost 1012 individual transitions. New features of the database include extensive
  “MARVELization” of line lists to allow them to be used for high resolutions studies,
  extension of several line lists to ultraviolet wavelengths, provision of photodissociation
  cross-sections and extended provision of broadening parameters. Some of the in-house
  data specifications have been rewritten in JSON and moved for conformity with other
  international standards. Data products, including specific heats, a database of
  lifetimes for plasma studies, and the ExoMolHR web app which allows exclusively
  high resolution data to be extracted, are discussed.
