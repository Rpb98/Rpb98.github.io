abstract: Modelling the red–blue asymmetries seen in the broad emission lines of core-collapse
  supernovae (CCSNe) is a powerful technique to quantify total dust mass formed in
  the ejecta at late times (&gt;5 yr after outburst) when ejecta dust temperatures
  become too low to be detected by mid-infrared (IR) instruments. Following our success
  in using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code damocles to measure the dust mass
  evolution in SN 1987A and other CCSNe, we present the most comprehensive sample
  of dust mass measurements yet made with damocles, for CCSNe aged between 4 and 60 yr
  after outburst. Our sample comprises multi-epoch late-time optical spectra taken
  with the Gemini/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) and Very Large Telescope
  (VLT) X-Shooter spectrographs, supplemented by archival spectra. For the 14 CCSNe
  that we have modelled, we confirm a dust mass growth with time that can be fit by
  a sigmoid curve that is found to saturate beyond an age of ∼30 yr, at a mass of
  0.23$^+0.17_-0.12$ M⊙. For an expanded sample including dust masses found in the
  literature for a further 11 CCSNe and six CCSN remnants, the dust mass at saturation
  is found to be 0.42$^+0.09_-0.05$ M⊙. Uncertainty limits for our dust masses were
  determined from a Bayesian analysis using the affine invariant Markov chain Monte
  Carlo ensemble sampler emcee with damocles. The best-fitting line profile models
  for our sample all required grain radii between 0.1 and 0.5 $μ$m. Our results are
  consistent with CCSNe forming enough dust in their ejecta to significantly contribute
  to the dust budget of the Universe.
