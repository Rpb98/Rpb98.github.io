abstract: To meet burning needs of high-resolution pressure-induced line-shape parameters
  in the UV/visible regions for hot-temperature industrial and atmospheric applications
  as well as current and future space missions, phase-shift theory is examined in
  its historical context, tested and revisited using accurate numerical potentials
  and advanced trajectory models. First, a general analysis for arbitrary molecular
  systems is conducted in terms of the dimensionless parameter α determined by the
  differences of the Lennard-Jones parameters in the final and initial electronic
  absorber’s states. Temperature dependence, use of the power law and influence of
  Maxwell–Boltzmann averaging over relative velocities are addressed. Then, interaction-potential
  calculations are attempted for some representative molecular pairs (NO-Ar, NO-N2,
  OH-Ar and OH-N2) and the isotropic parts are fitted using the 12-6 Lennard-Jones
  form to get room and high-temperature line-broadening and line-shift coefficients
  which are compared to available measurements. It is shown that the phase-shift theory
  in its standard rectilinear-trajectory formulation provides linewidth and shift
  estimates accurate within 30%–40%. Attempted improvements using numerical potentials
  and curved trajectories lead to closer matches with measurements for some cases
  but also worsen the agreement for others. To ensure better theoretical predictions,
  introduction of correction terms to the usual phase-shift integral is suggested.
