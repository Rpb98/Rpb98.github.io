      Degree: 1<sup>st</sup> class

      Masters Thesis: "ExoMol: A MARVEL analysis of experimental transition data and an ab initio line list for SO". The project involved collation of experimental transition data which where inverted to create an accurate empirical database of rotation-vibration energy levels with associated uncertainties and quantum number assignments. I also present a complex ab initio spectroscopic model for the sulfur monoxide diatom including 13 electronic states, 23 dipole and transition dipole moment curves, 23 spin-orbit curves, and 14 electronic angular momentum curves. The work lef to the following publication https://doi.org/10.1039/D2CP03051A.

## About Me

Hi! I am a Astrophysics graduate and current PhD student at UCL. My research interests include non-adiabatic dynamics for nuclear motion, high resolution molecular spectrocopy, data modelling, and the integration of computational physics with theoretical frameworks.

My hobbies include music, which I love, and I have played guitar for 11 years now. I also love to hike around the UK, and get a bit of fresh air!
