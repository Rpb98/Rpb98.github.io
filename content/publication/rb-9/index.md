abstract: The (time-independent) Schrödinger equation for atomistic systems is solved
  by using the adiabatic potential energy curves (PECs) and the associated adiabatic
  approximation. In cases where interactions between electronic states become important,
  the associated nonadiabatic effects are taken into account via derivative couplings
  (DDRs), also known as nonadiabatic couplings (NACs). For diatomic molecules, the
  corresponding PECs in the adiabatic representation are characterized by avoided
  crossings. The alternative to the adiabatic approach is the diabatic representation
  obtained via a unitary transformation of the adiabatic states by minimizing the
  DDRs. For diatomics, the diabatic representation has zero DDR and nondiagonal diabatic
  couplings ensue. The two representations are fully equivalent and so should be the
  rovibronic energies and wave functions, which result from the solution of the corresponding
  Schrödinger equations. We demonstrate (for the first time) the numerical equivalence
  between the adiabatic and diabatic rovibronic calculations of diatomic molecules
  using the ab initio curves of yttrium oxide (YO) and carbon monohydride (CH) as
  examples of two-state systems, where YO is characterized by a strong NAC, while
  CH has a strong diabatic coupling. Rovibronic energies and wave functions are computed
  using a new diabatic module implemented in the variational rovibronic code Duo.
  We show that it is important to include both the diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction
  and nondiagonal DDRs. We also show that the convergence of the vibronic energy calculations
  can strongly depend on the representation of nuclear motion used and that no one
  representation is best in all cases.
