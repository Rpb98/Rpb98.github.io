summary: A true Ω-representation as an adiabatic transformation of spin-orbit interactions and their associated non-adiabatic couplings.
abstract: 'Removal of Spin-Orbit couplings (SO) for diatomic systems is a well established method which is thought to reduce the complexity of the system of study. This is done via diagonalisation of the associated Hamiltonian matrix with potential energy curves (PECs), transforming from the coupled Λ−S (diabatic) basis to the Ω (adiabatic) representation where SO couplings vanish. This Ω–representation is thought to reduce the diatomic system to a desirable single state problem, which is simpler to treat and allows effective dipole moments to be computed for dipole-forbidden transitions. However, transforming to the Ω–representation does not completely decouple the system, in fact, strong non-adiabatic couplings (NACs) are introduced upon transformation of the kinetic energy, often ignored, and should be included. We show on selected diatomic systems that removal of SOC is not free, and omission of these “spin-orbit induced” NACs leads to gross errors into the rovibronic solution, unsuitable for high resolution spectroscopy, and a numerical equivalence between the Λ − S diabatic representation and Ω – adiabatic representation is achieved when all NAC terms are included. This is true for any unitary transformation on the diatomic Hamiltonian, *nothing is achieved for free and simplification of one part leads to the complication of another*.'
