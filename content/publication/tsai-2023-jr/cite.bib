 abstract = {Photochemistry is a fundamental process of planetary atmospheres
that regulates the atmospheric composition and stability1.
However, no unambiguous photochemical products have been detected
in exoplanet atmospheres so far. Recent observations from the
JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science
Program2,3 found a spectral absorption feature at 4.05 $μ$m
arising from sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of WASP-39b.
WASP-39b is a 1.27-Jupiter-radii, Saturn-mass (0.28 MJ) gas giant
exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star with an equilibrium
temperature of around 1,100 K (ref. 4). The most plausible way of
generating SO2 in such an atmosphere is through photochemical
processes5,6. Here we show that the SO2 distribution computed by
a suite of photochemical models robustly explains the 4.05-$μ$m
spectral feature identified by JWST transmission observations7
with NIRSpec PRISM (2.7$σ$)8 and G395H (4.5$σ$)9. SO2
is produced by successive oxidation of sulfur radicals freed when
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is destroyed. The sensitivity of the SO2
feature to the enrichment of the atmosphere by heavy elements
(metallicity) suggests that it can be used as a tracer of
atmospheric properties, with WASP-39b exhibiting an inferred
metallicity of about 10$\times$ solar. We further point out that
SO2 also shows observable features at ultraviolet and thermal
infrared wavelengths not available from the existing
observations.},
